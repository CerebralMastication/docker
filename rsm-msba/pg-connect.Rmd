```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

Startup the rsm-msba computing container by pasting the command below in a (bash) terminal and  ...

```bash
docker-compose -f ./rsm-msba/docker-rsm-msba-pg.yml up
```

... connect to the database using the code chunk below. The default password is "postgres" but you can, and probably should, change that in the docker compose file.

```{r}
library(RPostgreSQL)
library(dplyr)
con <- dbConnect(
  dbDriver("PostgreSQL"),
  user = "postgres", 
  host = "postgres",
  port = 5432,
  dbname = "postgres",
  password = rstudioapi::askForPassword("Database password")
)
```

Is there anything in the data base? If this is not the first time you are  running this Rmd file the data base should be available already (i.e., the code chunk below should show "flights" as an existing table)

```{r}
dbListTables(con)
```

If the database is empty, lets start with the example at https://db.rstudio.com/dplyr/ and work through the following 5 steps:

1. install the nycflights13 package

```{r}
install.packages("nycflights13")
```

2. Push data into the database 

```{r}
copy_to(con, nycflights13::flights, "flights",
  temporary = FALSE,
  indexes = list(
    c("year", "month", "day"),
    "carrier",
    "tailnum",
    "dest"
  )
)
```

3. Create a reference to the data base that (db)plyr can work with

```{r}
flights_db <- tbl(con, "flights")
```

4. Query the data base using (db)plyr

```{r}
flights_db %>% select(year:day, dep_delay, arr_delay)
flights_db %>% filter(dep_delay > 240)
flights_db %>%
  group_by(dest) %>%
  summarise(delay = mean(dep_time))

tailnum_delay_db <- flights_db %>% 
  group_by(tailnum) %>%
  summarise(
    delay = mean(arr_delay),
    n = n()
  ) %>% 
  arrange(desc(delay)) %>%
  filter(n > 100)

tailnum_delay_db
tailnum_delay_db %>% show_query()

nrow(tailnum_delay_db)
tail(tailnum_delay_db)

tailnum_delay <- tailnum_delay_db %>% collect()
nrow(tailnum_delay)
tail(tailnum_delay)
```

5. View the data in pgAdmin4

`pgAdmin4` should be running on http://localhost:5050/browser/

To connect to the data base, create a new "server" by right clicking on the `Server` icon and choosing _Create > Server_. In the  `General` and `Connection` tabs provide the information shown in the screen shots below and click on the `Save` icon.

See the screen shot below to access the `flights` table. Right click on `flights` and select _View/Edit Data > First 100 Rows_ to get a table view of the data.
